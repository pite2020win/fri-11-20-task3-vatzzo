# Matrix.


# Write a class that can represent any 4ùë•4 real matrix.
# Include two functions to calculate the sum and dot product of two matrices.
# Next, write a program that imports this library module and use it to perform calculations.
# You CAN'T use numpy.
# Examples:
#
# matrix_1 = Matrix(4.,5.,6.,7.)
# matrix_2 = Matrix(2.,2.,2.,1.)
#
# matrix_3 = matrix_2 @ matrix_1
# matrix_4 = matrix_2 + matrix_1
# matrix_4 = 6 + matrix_1
# matrix_4 = matrix_1 + 6
#
# expand your solution to include other operations like
# - subtraction
# - inversion
# - string representation
#
# Try to expand your implementation as best as you can.
# Think of as many features as you can, and try implementing them.
# Make intelligent use of pythons syntactic sugar (overloading, iterators, generators, etc)
# Most of all: CREATE GOOD, RELIABLE, READABLE CODE.
# The goal of this task is for you to SHOW YOUR BEST python programming skills.
# Impress everyone with your skills, show off with your code.
#
# Your program must be runnable with command "python task.py".
# Show some usecases of your library in the code (print some things)
# Delete these comments before commit!
#
# Good luck.
